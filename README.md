 Polo remastered in the Godot Engine

## Orgin of "Polo"
Polo is a game devloped by DrRaccoon and Cbdman25. As the original description states:

Polo is a 2D side-scrolling video game platforming game developed by Revolve Media. In the game, the player takes the role of a little block dude. The main goal of the game is fighting your way through various different worlds. The game was first released as an open beta. The full version is still being refined, but includes unlimited play.
Its a platformer that was born in early 2008 and has been a ongoing project ever since. The original intention of Polo was to be a platformer and to venture around the world, collecting coins, killing weird monsters and learning the story behind the game. Sadly, however, Polo was never finished.

The game has easily gone through 3 entire re-writes since the game was first started. Alot of the original builds have been lost to time, but a few (Original BBEv1 Engine) still linger around (BBEv2 Rewrite) on the internet. The latest of the older engine that exists is probably 1.6.3 (Last BBEv2 Build). Originally intended to be a Windows only platform, HTML5, Android and Linux builds of the game were experimented and toyed with for awhile. For a short time, the game even had online co-op play before being scrapped due to poor UDP netcode sync.

The Source Code and project files for the latest versions of Polo still exist today. How completion of Polo is highly unlikely anytime soon, if ever, due to full-time jobs and life overwelming any hopes of progress.
