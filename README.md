# Polo-Godot
 Polo remastered in the Godot Engine

## Orgin of "Polo"
Polo is a game devloped by DrRaccoon and Cbdman25. Originally, within Gamemaker 8.1. As the original description states:

> Polo is a 2D side-scrolling video game platforming game developed by Revolve Media. In the game, the player takes the role of a little block dude. The main goal of the game is fighting your way through various different worlds. The game was first released as an open beta. The full version is still being refined, but includes unlimited play.
Its a platformer that was born in early 2008 and has been a ongoing project ever since. The original intention of Polo was to be a platformer and to venture around the world, collecting coins, killing weird monsters and learning the story behind the game. Sadly, however, Polo was never finished.

The game has easily gone through 3 entire re-writes since the game was first started. Alot of the original builds have been lost to time, but a few (Original BBEv1 Engine) still linger around (BBEv2 Rewrite) on the internet. The latest of the older engine that exists is probably 1.6.3 (Last BBEv2 Build). Originally intended to be a Windows only platform, HTML5, Android and Linux builds of the game were experimented and toyed with for awhile. For a short time, the game even had online co-op play before being scrapped due to poor UDP netcode sync.

The original game is still [available to download](https://drraccoon.me/files/Polo1.6.3helms.zip).

## "Remaster" Objectives
It would be nice to breathe some life into the game again. Although, the list of milestones are as follows

- [x] Recreate core mechanics
- [x] Functional animation states for player
- [x] Tilesets and parallax background
- [ ] Add network play (2 players)
- [ ] Add network play (3-4 players)
- [ ] Add some original enemies

## Additional Assets
All other sprites, tilesets, sounds, and backgrounds exist in the original Gamemaker project file. The original game had 3 worlds, and several enemies.

## Music Theme Permission
The [Main Polo Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_2J2wtbCk) can be found here with original files available. Permission given from Filip Skutela.
> Sure, you can use the music as long as it is credited within your game with my nickname and/or real name (Lamb/Filip Skutela). What I'd like to ask is NOT to put my real name as a text on webpages with external game descriptions, credits etc. This is because of Google-search. I am committed into professional music composing here and possible search results with game-stuff etc. are no longer desirable for me.

With original music files: 
> There's also one thing I'd like to mention with your replaying routines. I don't know whether you're using module player or prerendered MP3/OGG file, but this tune is being played incorrectly. I'm sending you several versions at different bitrates as ready-to-use, as well as recommended player engine for XM files of mine (they are very hardly coded and most of players are not capable of handling 100% XM compatibility). I'm attaching a link because of gmail.com .exe file rejection:
